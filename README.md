# Color Mixing Puzzle

Mix colors to get to the target color!

A color mixing puzzle prototype to be used for [Nuevo Foundation](https://www.nuevofoundation.org/)'s annual Virtual Escape Room fundraiser 2025.

👉 Try it out [here](https://joaqor.trinket.io/sites/chroma-chemist-chameleon) (on Trinket).

## Running and modifying the puzzle locally
To run the Color Mixing Puzzle app locally, start a local server that serves the files from this repository, and then open `index.html` on your web browser from that local server.

One way to do the above is to use the [Live Preview extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) for Visual Studio Code. That will let you open the index.html, and it will also automatically reload it whenever you make code changes. 

Steps to open in Visual Studio Code:
* Install the [Live Preview extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) for Visual Studio Code
* Download the contents of this repository
* (only if you downloaded the repo as a zip file) Extract the zip file
* Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
* On the file navigator on the left, click on index.html to see the file in the editor. Then click on the "Show Preview" button on the top right of the editor to show the live preview.

## Editing the puzzle on Trinket

### Getting the code
If getting the code from Trinket, make sure to download the entire project as a ZIP file and extract it to your local machine. That will make sure that you have all the necessary files, including images.

### Uploading to Trinket
When uploading a project to Trinket, you'll need to add html and js files individually. To add images, click on the "View and add images" button on Trinket and upload the images one by one.

## 3rd Party Libraries
This code uses Phaser (https://phaser.io/) and Gauge.js (https://bernii.github.io/gauge.js/)
