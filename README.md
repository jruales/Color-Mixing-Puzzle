## Running and modifying the puzzle locally
In case you prefer to take advantage of the capabilities of a fully-featured code editor like Visual Studio Code, see these instructions below:

To run the Color Mixing Puzzle app locally, start a local server that serves the files from this repository, and then open `index.html` on your web browser from that local server.

One way to do the above is to use the [Live Preview extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) for Visual Studio Code. That will let you open the index.html, and it will also automatically reload it whenever you make code changes. 

Steps to open in Visual Studio Code:
* Install the [Live Preview extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) for Visual Studio Code
* Download the contents of this repository
* (only if you downloaded the repo as a zip file) Extract the zip file
* Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
* On the file navigator on the left, click on index.html to see the file in the editor. Then click on the "Show Preview" button on the top right of the editor to show the live preview.

## 3rd Party Libraries
This code uses Phaser (https://phaser.io/) and Gauge.js (https://bernii.github.io/gauge.js/)
